\title{E-Lab: Web based system for solving and automatic assessment of
programming problems}

\author{Tomche Delev}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

\emph{E-Lab} is a system developed at Faculty of Computer Science and
Engineering for solving and auto-grading programming problems from introduction
programming courses. The main goal is to simplify, better organize and
improve the process of solving programming problems from large group of
students in dedicated computer labs using centralized server. All the work from
the students is done in a web browser using a web-based code editor and
everything is stored, compiled and executed on the server. All the
problems and solutions are under version control system (Git). The platform
supports different types of problems in several programming languages (C, C++,
Java) and it's designed to be easily extended.

\section{Introduction}
Programming is one of the essential practical skills taught at introduction
level courses in computer science curriculums. Mastering this skill can gain the
students good chances of finding fair job and developing successful career. The
rewarding career and the constant rising of the market for programmers makes the
computer science programs very popular among high school students. The results
are large introduction classes with several hundred students enrolled. 

Programming is not an easy skill to develop. By some studies
\cite{winslow1996programming} mastering this skill requires up to ten years. As
easy as it seems teaching basic programming rises challenges to the academic
stuff and good organisation with the right tools is required to tackle these
challenges. Similarly to other practical skills, good strategy for learning
programming involves great amount of time actually doing it. For introduction
level courses involving some kind of programming, this translates to solving a
lot of basic algorithmic examples. One third of the time teaching these courses
is dedicated to solving this kind of programming problems organized in problem sets by the
topic and executed in dedicated computer labs.

Several hundred students working on problems every week, produces thousands
solutions in form of source code that should be examined and graded. In the
current environment students work on PC workstations using simple text
editor or some kind of IDE for the programming language they use. They save,
compile and execute the solutions on their local machines. After they finish, no
records of their work is stored on server repository, so there is no
possibility for the instructors to examine and grade their solutions afterwards.
The time limit for each group of students is in the range of 90 to 120 minutes,
and the instructors usually have only up to 30 minutes to examine, test and
grade 20 students, each with several solutions. These settings makes almost
impossible for the instructors to quality assess the students work.

The nature of the programming problems in great part of the introduction
programming courses is algorithmic. This makes it possible to develop a fairly
simple platform for creating problems, test cases and system for automatic
assessment and grading the solutions. Most algorithmic problems can be
designed to take some input from the standard input in some prescribed format,
apply some simple algorithm in memory, and finally produce an output in some
prescribed format and print it on the standard output. Having this kind of
problems we can take the executable of the program, feed the test input and then
compare and verify for correctness on the test output. This process which is
widely used in many competitive programming systems, should emphasize the
importance in programming to have a working solutions, instead of only writing a
code that some times even doesn't compile.

The E-Lab system is developed with many goals. If the first goal was to better
handle the organization and implementation of the programming exercises, other
important goals are the motivation of the students and the continuous feedback
they will have using this platform. With E-Lab we want to shift the role of the
instructors from teachers and graders to motivators, which is shown to give
better effects in teaching programming \cite{jenkins2001teaching}.

\section{Related work}

Systems that automatically assess programming assignments have been designed and
used for more than forty years. In \cite{douce2005automatic} authors review
a number of the influential systems for automatic test-based assessment
of programming assignments. These systems are broadly categorized according to
age in three generations. 

The first generation or early assessment systems were
those originate from the time when programming was done using punch cards and
the evaluation was done by executing programs and manually evaluating the
output. Some of these early systems had specially designed programs to
compare the output of the execution to some predefined output. 

The second generation or the tool oriented assessment systems are developed
using preexisting tool sets and utilities supplied with the operating system or
programming environment. One notable example of these systems is the BOSS
system originated at the University of Warwick in the UK \cite{joy2005boss} which in
his last development cycles has become an assessment management system. Other
example is the Scheme-Robo project \cite{saikkonen2001fully} which has been
supplemented by a graphical user interface and an algorithm-animation component.

The third-generation assessment system are characterized by using the latest
developments in web technology and adopt advanced testing approaches. Previously
mentioned system BOSS has evolved in this generation. CourseMarker, developed at
Nottingham University \cite{higgins2003coursemarker} and RoboProf deployed at
Dublin City University \cite{daly2004automated} are examples of this last
generation of automatic assessment systems.

\section{The E-Lab philosophy}

We developed E-Lab with the idea that we should build it using the latest web
technologies and state of the art tools that have been proven to work over the
years. The result is a forth generation system, where we integrate latest
technologies to produce modern, extendable, scalable and easy to use platform.
We achieve this using the experience over the years observing students working
on programming problems in introduction level courses. 

\subsection{Integrated problem view}

Most of the time available to students trying to solve the problems in the
dedicated computer labs is (or should be) spent in three equally important
phases. In the first phase students should carefully read and understand the problems,
the second phase should be the coding part in which they can refer to the
related course material, and in the third and final phase they should get the
feedback for the correctness of their solution.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.99\textwidth]{e-lab/user_screen}
\caption{The student screen trying to solve a problem.}
\label{fig:student_screen}
\end{figure}

According to this observation, the platform was designed in such a manner, so
that on a single screen students can work and accomplish all the phases involved
in solving the problems. As can be seen on figure \ref{fig:student_screen}, on
that single screen we have the problem text to be read, the web-based code
editor to write the solution and the actions pane, so they can run their
solution and get instant feedback in the output area. With this design we try to
implement the extreme apprenticeship method \cite{vihavainen2011extreme} which
is based on a set of values and practices that emphasize learning by doing,
together with continuous feedback as the most efficient means for learning
programming.

\subsection{Authentication}
All users of the system are authenticated using the Central Authentication
System (CAS) which is used by all services at the faculty. With this mechanism
we can identify students and their solutions, and later use this identity to
export attandance and score records or check for plagiarism, malicious code or
other abusive usages.

\subsection{Problems design}
The central entity in the programming exercises are the programming problems.
Each problem is designed in two phases. In the first phase we define the problem
text, name and in some problems provide starter code. This information define
only the basis of the problem, so in the second phase we need to provide sample
input and output for the problem as an example, and at least one test case, also
in form of input and output data, so the solutions of the problem can be tested.
For each problem, we can also add contextual help or hints that can be helpful
for students to solve the problem.

\subsection{Automatic assessment}
Having limited resources in time and the actual inability to assess all of the
student solutions to the given problems makes the automatic assessment
top priority in the platform. Since the platform covers only introduction level
courses in programming and algorithms, most of the problems can be designed so
they can be assessed by simple black-box testing methodology. For each problem
the author provides a reference solution, and using this solution the system
generates test cases. Each test case consists of simple input and output text
files. When the system tests the solution, if it's compiled successfully, the
executable is fed with the input file and to be correct it should print out
the same output as the contents in the generated output file. One of the test
cases is a sample and is visible for the students, so they can better understand
the problem. Each problem should have at least one test case and up to ten test
cases. We choose to limit the number of test cases, to be able to provide
instant feedback. If we have more test cases, then if their execution always
results in time out (the program doesn't end in a limited time), the user will
need to wait this time out period times the number of test cases.

\section{Architecture}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.99\textwidth]{e-lab/architecture}
\caption{The E-Lab architecture.}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The overview of the system architecture can be seen on figure
\ref{fig:architecture}, showing it's primary components. The data repository
is the most interesting component of the system. We propose a specific way of
storing the problems and all the work from the students by using a combination
of database and file system. All the relational data and metadata of the
problems such as the name, the problem set it belongs, the text, is stored in
relational database. The other part containing the starter code, reference
solution, help contents in markup text and all the test cases in form of
input and output text files are stored on the file system. And finally, all of
the students' solutions are stored solely on the file system in organized
directory structure.

\subsection{Problems and solutions repository}
Almost all of the problems information and solutions are in form of simple text
or source code files. Very practical way of storing this kind of data is using
some kind of version control system. With this system we get features such as
management of the changes of the documents and full revision tracking
capabilities. The choice of Git, which is very fast distributed revision control
system, gives the system the reliability of the distributed repositories that
doesn't depend on single server.

\subsection{The client-server}

The system is a form of a standard client-server web architecture. This
architecture allows the client, which is standard and web browser available on
all platforms, to run on virtually every PC in our computer lab environment.
This lowers the costs of maintenance of the computer labs, because no specific
software such as separate client software, compilers, IDEs or text editors
should be installed and maintained.

The web server is composed of two separate servers. The front-end web server is
a fast web server that serves as a fast proxy and load balancer to the
application server. The application server is Java server that uses a scalable
RESTfull architecture. The web applications on this server follows the MVC
architectural pattern applied to the web architecture. The authentication of the
users is done on a central authentication server using HTTPS. 

\subsection{Asynchronous jobs}
In our architecture as in most web based architectures, the web application
server is intended to work with very short requests. It uses a fixed thread pool
to process requests queued by the HTTP connector. To get optimum results, the
thread pool should be as small as possible. The typical optimum value for the
default pool size is the number of processors + 1.

That means that if a request is very long, such as waiting the execution of a
program that times out (for example 3 seconds), will block the thread pool and
penalize the application responsiveness. Of course, we could add more threads to
the pool, but it will result in wasted resources, and anyway the pool size will
never be infinite.

In the example when users submitting solutions that should be tested on 3 test
cases and each of these solutions times out (3 seconds), then the request
will last at least 9 seconds (3 test cases x 3 seconds each). When 10 users
simultaneously try to submit their solutions, the server will need at least 10
execution threads. This number is feasible, but if we want to have scalable
system that supports hundreds or more users submitting solutions, we need
different approach.

In these cases, our web framework allows us to temporarily suspend the request. 
The HTTP request will stay connected, but the request execution will be popped
out of the thread pool and tried again later. We execute our long lasting
operations such as compiling, saving and executing in an asynchronous way. We
use for execution, something called asynchronous job, and while these jobs are
executing, the HTTP request is suspended and waits for the result to be
available. When the jobs are done with the execution the HTTP request resumes
and returns the result to the user.

\subsection{Sandboxed execution}
The system allows students to write, run and execute any kind of program code
that will be executed on a remote server. This can harm the server in many
undesirable ways. The malicious code can contain unprivileged read and write
access, can create fork bombs, allocate all the available memory or simply
consume all the processing power the server has. To control or prevent
these security issues all the execution is done in a ``sandbox'' environment. In
this sandbox each execution is limited by processing time and memory, and also
constrained in the number of processes it can fork.


\section{Detecting plagiarism}
Source code plagiarism is a serious problem and it's one of the reasons for the
large percentage of students in final years of computer science programs who
actually can't code at all. The large number of submissions makes it very
difficult to manually check for evidences of plagiarism in all possible
combinations of solutions. We must use some automatic system for
plagiarism detection. Automatic plagiarism detection has been the subject of
many studies \cite{baker1995finding}, \cite{clough2000plagiarism} and there are
many systems available online. 

In the E-Lab system we incorporate one of these systems trying to prevent and
detect plagiarism cases. We use the MOSS system developed by Alex Aiken at UC
Berkeley \cite{aiken2005moss}. The ``Measure Of Software Similarity'' system
makes it possible to objectively and automatically check all problem solutions
for evidence of plagiarism or simple copying. MOSS works with programming
languages like C, C++, Java, Python and many others. The strategy in our system
is to present it very clear to the students, that their solutions will be
checked for plagiarism against all solutions submitted by other students. Some
of the introduction level problems have very short and simple solutions. We exclude
these submissions from plagiarism detection, because the nature of these
problems makes it very difficult to write conceptually different solutions.

\section{Conclusion}

With the development and introduction of the E-Lab system we try to address
many organizational aspects of the lab exercises from introduction
level programming courses at our faculty. We try to simplify and improve the process
of creating and managing simple programming problems. The system is focused on
the student and his work and the role of the instructors is to motivate and help
students to write working solutions for most of the problems. 

The implementation of the
central and reliable data repository should also bring many advantages. It
contains all students solutions and other important information such as the time when
problems were solved or time needed to solve. All the solutions are version
controlled, so we can track and analyze the stages in solving and fixing bugs
from beginner programmer perspective. All these records, provides us with
valuable information from the learning process of the students. From this data,
very easy we can extract information such as students attendance records and
final scores.

With this system, we are not trying to solve all the organizational and
educational problems or entirely exclude the human factor. E-Lab is developed to
help with these problems and create modern environment that will motivate and
support students work in programming.
